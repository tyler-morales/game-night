# GameNight

GameNight is a web app that records & analyzes group game nights without the hassle of tracking everything by hand with pencil and paper.

## üìñ Background

Having watched my family record countless domino games by hand with post-it notes and scratch pads, and seeing their struggle in organizing and tracking their games, I decided to upgrade their form of record-keeping to an online platform.

In addition to tracking games by hand, the issue of recording who won became an issue. While physical pieces of paper have finite space to write, an online application does not have to conform to those limitations and can record much more data as well as display connections between their data as charts and graphs in a visual format.

This began the month-long push of creating GameNight.

## üèÜ Goals

The two main goals of this project are to:

1. Learn about serverless architecture
2. Create a useful product that can be used in the real world.

Specifically, I want to do a deep dive into AWS products such as Amplify, Cognito, and Dynamo DB as well as learn more about GraphQL.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How GameNight Works

A group, defined as a family unit or collection of friends, can create a single account to track their entire group. Within this account, anyone can add members, games, and/ or record a game. This single account login allows any member at any time the freedom to edit the account. The idea behind this is that, while there may be multiple players who play a game, there only needs to be one player to record the game. This eliminates the need for every player to update the account and saves time.

Once members and games are added, a game can be recorded, and then the dashboard page will populate with data.

All users has their own collection of memmbers, games, and games played. This process is handled through user authenticaiton that filters data per account.

## üõ† Features

- üèó **Create** and edit members and games to your account
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Record** every game you play
- üìä **Analyze** data from recorded games in visual graphs and charts

The analysis is the most interesting feature due to the endless possibilities of data visualization. Currently, GameNight offers four views of analysis:

- **Game History**: A table view listing each recorded game
- **Leaderboard**: A bar chart listing the number of wins and losses each player has per game
- **Game Distribution**: A pie chart depicting the fractions of games played
- **Game Activity**: A heatmap showcasing how often games are played by anyone in the group

## üíª Tech Stack

| Front End      | Backend                           | Packages       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| React/ Next js | AWS Amplify (Hosting & CI/CD)     | Recharts       |
| Tailwind css   | AWS Cognito (User Authentication) | Framer Motion  |
|                | AWS Dynamo DB (Database)          | Formik (Forms) |
|                | GraphQL (API)                     |                |

## üîÆ Future Features

1. **Blog**
   Due to the statistical nature of this website, I want to include a blog feature that explains in-depth the statistics that are included. For example, if a user is confused about what exactly the heatmap is, they can click the info button and be directed to the blog entry to explain what that means.

2. **User Feedback Section**
   In order to better deliver what users want, I want to include a simple way for users to ask for what they want to see added or modified to the website.
